## About The Repository

I have added some programs on the basic concepts of Python for starters. The concepts are regarding Functions, conditional statements, iterations, strings, lists, tuples and dictionaries etc.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Grade Printing

In this program, conditional if-else, elif statements are used to produce grades on numbers given by the user.

In the first step, five numbers of floating number datatupe in respective subjects are input by the user and stored in five variables.

Then, the numbers are added and stored in a variable sum. Afterwards sum is divided by the total number of subjects i.e, 5 to get the average.

After getting the average in a variable avg, if-else elif condition is used to compare the avg in order to assign grade.

The grades, according to the average marks are A,B,C,D,E and F.

if the average is higher than or equal to 90 and smaller than 100, then it will print grade A.

if the average is higher than or equal to 80 and smaller than 90, then it will print grade B.

if the average is higher than or equal to 70 and smaller than 80, then it will print grade C.

if the average is higher than or equal to 60 and smaller than 70, then it will print grade D.

if the average is higher than or equal to 50 and smaller than 60, then it will print grade E.

if the average is higher than or equal to 0 and smaller than 50, then it will print grade F.

if the average marks are not between 0 to 100, then the else option will be printed, which will give a warning that the numbers entered are wrong.
